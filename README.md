# movie-recommendation-system
This is an AI/ML project made by me under the guidance of @campusx-official on YouTube, without his help this project wouldn't be possible.

# How does this project works?
Well the concept used in this project is very old but very accurate and can be used in wide varity of data. We are using <i> Content Based Recommendation System </i>
In this system we uses tags to compare one data with the other. 

Here, movie-recommender-system.ipyb is a Jupyter Notebook which contains main code. It takes the Data Frame from provided csv files and then preprocess the data by making the data cleaner and simple to create tags. Then we deploy the code with the help of streamlit in the app.py file.
